# speedtest-dashboard
Based on the application [speedtest-tracker](https://github.com/alexjustesen/speedtest-tracker) and its integration with InfluxDB, I created the following Grafana dashboard to be able to have quick access to the important information as fast as possible.
In the future to come, I'll be adding delay and jitter as well, but more importantly than just displaying the information, it is imporant to make it meanigful and avoid cluttering the dashboard with a lot of information.
